Because of that...\n--> 2) They don't specialize enough. Revenue uncertainty leads to accepting too many different deals. Because of that...\n--> 3) They don't create conveyor-belt style service delivery. Everything they sell is a custom-tailored suit. Because of that...\n--> 4) They cannot delegate or automate. Everything depends on the founder. Because of that...\n--> 5) They don't have enough time to think strategically and systemically\n--> back to 1)\n\nSo far, EVERY single client of ours who consistently applied our methodology had at least 300% ROI. That's why we say: If you don't make your money back with our systems in the first 6 months of working with us, we'll refund you.\n\nKNOW MORE? \nLearn more & book a call at www.alphaleadacademy.com",

I am Ruthu Srihari am a BBA graduate from Centre of management studies, Bangalore. I have completed Level 4 in \"Applied marketing\" from Chartered Institute of Marketing from London and have completed a course on \"Market Research and Consumer Behavior\" from IE Business School. I have co-authored and published a research paper called \" Marketing Practices during Covid 19 in India\" in the Aegaeum journal from Belgium which is under the UGC care. I have also created an e-commerce website about automobiles from the Czech Republic for the International management day at my college. I am really keen on marketing and the different aspects of marketing and it is my college major as well. The huge billboards with models flaunting their pieces of art, a bar of soap looking like a perfect spa dream, and even a bar of small bar chocolate satisfying a bunch of hungry people always caught my attention and got me thinking about how a simple yet intricate concept of marketing can build millions of businesses. I was a content writer and a digital marketing intern at DHS informatics, Envitest, Omegaon. I am currently working as a content manager at M56 Studios. I also have prepared quizzes about food, sports, entertainment, history, books, and many more. I write a lot of poems and stories and I'm good at expressing feelings well. I am very interested in psychology and I have studied for 6 months of organizational psychology. I'm really creative in developing new ideas for sales marketing and promotion. I'm open to learning more and I am a fast teacher as well. My communication is not only through words but with my actions. I can really manage a team. I worked in the hospitality and logistics team in my college for one year. I'm not only good at leadership or in organizing but I'm good at doing what people really want. I can do good to the team members and also others. My hobbies are cooking, painting, writing, and painting. I have a keen interest in the food industry and learn about food every day. I'm great at connecting with people with whom I share common interests and food is my way to do that.",

And I've spend the last decade doing exactly that - not just by creating content, but by building organic distribution, systems, communities, teams, and the content thesis behind it. \n\nI started at a digital agency in 2015 when brands were just waking up to social media. I gained early exposure to digital platforms, audience behavior and metrics and very quickly, found merit in working on content that found its own audience, without marketing spends. \n\nI joined Pocket Aces in 2017 (FilterCopy, Dice Media, Gobble, Nutshell) as a founding member and set up and scaled branded content from scratch - before it became a buzzword :) I then went on to lead Content Strategy across our fiction and non-fiction channels. \n\nEventually, I headed FilterCopy, one of India’s most loved youth content platforms, scaling it to 3B+ annual organic views and a 20M+ audience across YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat, organically and profitably, with a team I am still proud of! \n\nI've produced 15+ high-retention IPs (social and OTT), content amassing 10B+ organic views, worked with 300+ brands - guiding them not just on what content to make, but how to measure the real impact of storytelling, beyond views.\n\nI am always looking for more ways to bring the audience to the right content!

My work spans geoengineering and renewable energy grid modeling I am currently researching Stratospheric Aerosol Injection in the Climate Engineering group and clean energy grid optimization for New York State in the Anderson Lab. In effect, a clean grid helps prevent a climate emergency, while geoengineering explores last-resort solutions to stabilize Earth's climate if we fall short. I started out in hardware prototyping and design with Formula Student, but over time, my focus shifted toward computational modeling, optimization, and climate science. This blend of hands-on and analytical experience helps me approach problems from both a technical and systems-level perspective. Im currently looking for internship opportunities in places where I can grow and apply my skills in modeling, optimization, energy systems and climate dynamics to real-world climate challenges.

That shaped how I show up today: with grit, creativity, and a deep sense of ownership—in work and in life.\n\nProfessionally, I care deeply about:\n✨ Growth strategy that’s both creative and data-driven\n✨ Leading with clarity, calm, and care\n✨ Building strong, resilient teams that do work they’re proud of\n\nPersonally, I’ve learned the power of sharing what’s real—especially the harder parts.\nIf anything I’ve experienced can help someone else feel less alone, more seen, or more supported in their own journey… I’m here for that too.\n\nI’m not here to be perfect—just real.\nAnd if what I share helps even one person grow, that’s enough for me.\n\nAdditional:\nFluent in Spanish, conversational in Bengali.\nRelevant international experience in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.",

I develop methods in Computational Learning Theory (COLT) and Mathematics of Data Science (MDS) Techniques and focus on building Pointwise smooth approximations of gradient, discovering activation functions from data, smoothness and convexity studies of loss functions, methods in interpretable deep learning, novel loss functions in back-propagation, Chaos-causality in Deep Neural Networks and pruning/compression in Deep Networks. My Goals include Efficient, reliable and robust Inferences (One Landscape) via tools such as Measure Theory, Non-Linear Optimization, Functional Analysis, Econometrics and Dynamical Systems.
