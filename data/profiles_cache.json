I am Ruthu Srihari am a BBA graduate from Centre of management studies, Bangalore. I have completed Level 4 in \"Applied marketing\" from Chartered Institute of Marketing from London and have completed a course on \"Market Research and Consumer Behavior\" from IE Business School. I have co-authored and published a research paper called \" Marketing Practices during Covid 19 in India\" in the Aegaeum journal from Belgium which is under the UGC care. I have also created an e-commerce website about automobiles from the Czech Republic for the International management day at my college. I am really keen on marketing and the different aspects of marketing and it is my college major as well. The huge billboards with models flaunting their pieces of art, a bar of soap looking like a perfect spa dream, and even a bar of small bar chocolate satisfying a bunch of hungry people always caught my attention and got me thinking about how a simple yet intricate concept of marketing can build millions of businesses. I was a content writer and a digital marketing intern at DHS informatics, Envitest, Omegaon. I am currently working as a content manager at M56 Studios. I also have prepared quizzes about food, sports, entertainment, history, books, and many more. I write a lot of poems and stories and I'm good at expressing feelings well. I am very interested in psychology and I have studied for 6 months of organizational psychology. I'm really creative in developing new ideas for sales marketing and promotion. I'm open to learning more and I am a fast teacher as well. My communication is not only through words but with my actions. I can really manage a team. I worked in the hospitality and logistics team in my college for one year. I'm not only good at leadership or in organizing but I'm good at doing what people really want. I can do good to the team members and also others. My hobbies are cooking, painting, writing, and painting. I have a keen interest in the food industry and learn about food every day. I'm great at connecting with people with whom I share common interests and food is my way to do that.",

In effect, a clean grid helps prevent a climate emergency, while geoengineering explores last-resort solutions to stabilize Earth's climate if we fall short. I started out in hardware prototyping and design with Formula Student, but over time, my focus shifted toward computational modeling, optimization, and climate science. This blend of hands-on and analytical experience helps me approach problems from both a technical and systems-level perspective.
